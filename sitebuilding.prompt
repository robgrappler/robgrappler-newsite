You are a senior web designer and frontend architect building a high-end, underground grappling brand website called "Robgrappler".

GOAL
Create a modern, responsive, conversion-focused website for Robgrappler:
- Core purpose: sell premium wrestling/grappling video matches and subscriptions.
- Vibe: high-end underground fight club + luxury fetish aesthetics, but keep it PG-13 and non-explicit.
- Priority: make it EASY to buy matches and subscribe.

BRAND & VISUALS
Use this visual identity:
- Brand name: Robgrappler
- Palette:
  - Dark Gold: #F5C265 (accents, buttons, key text, thin borders)
  - Deep Purple: #10051F (primary background)
  - Near Black: #020308 (page background / sections)
  - Neutral Gray for body text
- Typography:
  - Headings: bold, condensed, masculine display font (e.g. similar to Bebas Neue)
  - Body: clean, modern sans-serif (e.g. similar to Inter)
- Style:
  - Dark mode only
  - Strong contrast
  - Subtle gradients and glow behind key elements (not neon club trash)
  - Use gold sparingly as highlight, never as giant flat background

LAYOUT & SECTIONS
Build a single-page layout with clear sections:

1) Sticky Navbar
   - Logo / wordmark: "Robgrappler"
   - Links: "Matches", "Subscriptions", "About", "FAQ", "Contact"
   - Right side: primary CTA button: "Enter The Mat" (scrolls to pricing/subscriptions)

2) Hero Section (above the fold)
   - Full-width dark hero with:
     - Main headline: something like "Underground Grappling. No Fluff. Just Pressure."
     - Subheadline: 1–2 lines about premium, intense, real wrestling matches.
     - Two CTAs:
       - Primary (gold button): "Watch Full Matches"
       - Secondary (outlined): "Browse Match Library"
     - Space for a large thumbnail/video preview area (mock a match highlight card)
   - Add small trust badges below CTAs, e.g. “No scripts, no fake moves”, “HD Downloads”, “Secure payment”.

3) Featured Matches Section
   - Grid or cards for 3–6 "featured matches".
   - Each card: thumbnail placeholder, match title, short description, duration, difficulty/intensity tags.
   - Each card has a "View Match" button.
   - Design this so more cards can be added easily later.

4) Subscriptions / Pricing Section
   - 2–3 tier pricing layout:
     - Example tiers: "Single Match", "Monthly Access", "VIP Library"
     - Include price, what’s included, and a clear gold CTA button per tier ("Get Access").
   - Highlight one recommended tier with stronger visual emphasis.

5) About Section
   - Short story about Robgrappler:
     - Real grappling, pressure-heavy style, competitive intensity.
     - No fake drama, just holds, scrambles, dominance.
   - Layout: one column text + one side visual placeholder (image or video).

6) FAQ Section
   - Simple accordion-style or stacked questions:
     - "How do I watch my purchased matches?"
     - "Are these real competitive matches?"
     - "Can I download the videos?"
     - "What payment methods do you accept?"

TECH & IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
- Use semantic HTML5.

- Make it fully responsive (mobile-first).
- Use consistent spacing scale and vertical rhythm.
- Avoid unnecessary libraries and bloat.
- Include subtle hover states on buttons and cards.
- Do NOT include any backend code, only frontend.

INTERACTIVITY
- Optional: small, subtle scroll or fade-in animations using simple CSS or minimal JS.
- Optional: highlight active nav link based on scroll position.

OUTPUT FORMAT
1) Full HTML document with <head>, <body>, and all sections.
2) CSS (Tailwind classes directly in HTML OR a separate <style> block if using vanilla CSS).
3) Very short note at the end explaining where to:
   - Change colors
   - Update match cards
   - Update pricing tiers
Start by outputting the full HTML and CSS.
